# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Growth

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A hand-draw 2D RPG where the player explores different zones, collects better gear, and obtain abilities to prepare for a final boss that incorporates what the player has learned.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want my project to be a simple but addicting 2D RPG. The player starts with basic stats and abilities, and by defeating enemies and completing small quests, they get a random item within a loot pool. There will be visible health and mana bars, and unlockable abilities as the player progresses. Some NPCS will offer quests and challenges that will reward loot if completed. I will be designing the background, enemies, and soundtracks that match the atmosphere. The player will unlock new regions after completing a section, eventually facing a final boss.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Working movement, combat, proper item scaling, at least one completed zone.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

More zones, bosses, working inventory and loot drops, unlockable abilities.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Multiple zones with final boss, NPCs with rewards, all original sprites and background, original soundtrack, save function.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be to start with core mechanics. This will be the movement, combat system, etc. before adding visuals. I'll need to learn more about sprite animation, and being able to have an inventory system. Once the basics are completed, I will start working on the zones. After finishing one zone, the rest should be easier.
